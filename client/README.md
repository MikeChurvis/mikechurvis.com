Hi! I'm Mike, a web developer based near Atlanta, Georgia. 

I built this website from scratch five times.
Each time, I built it a different way.
Each way had its ups, downs, and dead-ends; I studied each in detail. 
I learned to not spurn these impediments as mere failures, but welcome them as chances to understand *why* things fail.

I bring this philosophy to everything I do.
I learn by doing, and I love to learn.
